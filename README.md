Project Description
## Vodafone Cash Clone
The Vodafone Cash Clone Mini Console Application is a C++ project that aims to
Simulate the core functionalities of a mobile financial service similar to Vodafone
Cash. This project provides a simplified version of the Vodafone Cash platform,
Allowing users to perform basic financial transactions through a console
Interface. Users can send and receive money, check their balance, buy airtime,
And handle other essential mobile money operations.
The application must include user registration and login, balance inquiry, money
Transfer, receipt of money, airtime purchase, transaction history viewing, PIN
Change, simulated network interaction, error handling, and an exit option for
Basic mobile financial transactions simulation.
Implementation: The implementation of the project will involve using C++,
Making use of functions, data structures, and conditional statements. Storage of
Data can be organized through constructs such as arrays or linked lists, while
User authentication, transaction history, and account balances can be emulated
By employing suitable data structures.
